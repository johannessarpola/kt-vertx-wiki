= Wiki

Testing Kotlin + Vertx combo in creating a simple wiki. 

Based on tutorial found on Vertx page and Vertx Maven starter (https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-maven-starter). 

Not really useful software, but interesting learning experience. 

There's two ways implemented some Vertx features. <name>Ext.kt is proxy based service and without 'ext'-suffix is done through the message bus. Latter is not really updated so it might not work, just left it for reminder.
